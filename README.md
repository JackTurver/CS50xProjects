# CS50xProjects

//This repository is used to show my CS50x Harvard course projects
//I am hoping once I have completed this course to start a role as a software engineer
//The first languages I will attempt to master will most likely be Python, JavaScript and C

//The LOTR game.sb3 file is a basic scratch game. This is the project submission for the first week of the CS50x course.

//The .c files are projects from the second week of the CS50x course.
