# CS50xProjects

//This repository is used to show my CS50x Harvard course projects
//The first commited file was a rock paper scissors python file in order to set the repository up and is not included in the course projects
//I am hoping once I have completed this course and have learned the full syntax of a programming language to start a role as a software engineer
//The first languages I will attempt to master will molst likely be Python, JavaScript and C
//The LOTR game.sb3 file is a basic scratch game. This is the project submission for the first week of the CS50x course.
