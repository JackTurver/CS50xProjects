Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: TODO

Some of the highest rated teams were the only ones with a chance of winning with the lowest number of simulations.
As the simulations increased it showed that the lowest rankedteams didn't have a 0% chance of winning but actually just a very small chance.
The highest ranked teams didn't have quite as high a % chance of winning as simulation increased as the value became more accurate.


Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: TODO

After 1000 simulations I would call the predictions good enough as all teams were given a percentage chance to win.
The real time taken to compute the calculation was only around 0.004s slower than 10 and 100 simulations.
Also the % chances to win for 10000 and 100000 were very close to these values but if each second was charged a fee then the difference in time taken wouldn't be worth it past 1000 simulations.
